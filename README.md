# Bowling Solitaire Simulator

## Overview

I was curious how often it's possible to bowl a strike in the card game [Bowling Solitaire](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25314/bowling-solitaire) so I wrote a simulator which randomly generates games and iterates the state tree to figure out whether or not a strike is possible.

## Running

```
./bin/simulate 1000
```
